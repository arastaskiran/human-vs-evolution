<h1 align="center">Human Vs Evolution / Cargo Game</h1>
<div align="left">
It might be hard to believe, but in the country where I live, there are still people who view evolution as a belief system and claim not to believe in it. Therefore, I aim to visually demonstrate evolution to these individuals by using evolutionary algorithms. For this purpose, I am considering creating a series of games using evolutionary algorithms, and "Cargo Game" will be one of them.

While developing the software, I am careful not to use any third-party components to showcase evolution in a single code base. This may take some time, but I prefer to do it this way.

The rules of the Cargo Game are as follows:
</div>
<br/>

<div align="left">
1) You have a cargo container with its capacity randomly determined.
</div>
<br/>

<div align="left">
2) At the beginning of the game, you are given a certain amount of time to fill the container with the most valuable products possible. However, you are responsible for calculating the total limit and price to maintain fairness.
</div>
<br/>

<div align="left">
3) After making your choice, the game starts, and evolution comes into play, making choices under the same conditions. Therefore, you are competing with evolution, and the winner is the one who can make the best choice in the shortest time.
</div>
<br/>

<div align="left">
4) Of course, winning this game is not possible, but someone who doesn't believe in evolution must be able to win this competition.
